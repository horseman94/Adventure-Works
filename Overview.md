### Overview


This project focuses on the critical initial phase of data analysis: Data Cleaning and Preparation. Across multiple datasets, we address common challenges such as missing values, inconsistent data types, and non-standardized entries.

The meticulous execution of these cleaning and preparation steps is fundamental, as it ensures the reliability, accuracy, and usability of the data, thereby laying a robust foundation for subsequent in-depth analysis and deriving actionable business insights, particularly when integrating with tools like Power BI.
